This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a loan will be approved based on applicant demographic and financial details. It demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

📌 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deployment: Streamlit / Flask

Version Control: Git & GitHub

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing – handled missing values, encoded categorical features, dropped unnecessary columns.

Feature Engineering – engineered important features like credit history and income percentile.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – analyzed correlations and visualized key drivers of loan approval.

Model Training & Evaluation – trained multiple models, with best results from Support Vector Machine (SVM), validated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Deployment – built a Streamlit/Flask web app to allow real-time loan approval prediction.

📊 Results

Achieved high accuracy with SVM.

Identified credit history and income levels as key factors in loan approval.

Deployed an interactive app for real-time prediction.
